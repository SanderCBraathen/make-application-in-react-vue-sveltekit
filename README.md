### **Step 1: Download and Install Raspberry Pi Imager**
1. **Go to the Raspberry Pi website** and download the Raspberry Pi Imager:
   - [Download Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/)
2. **Install Raspberry Pi Imager** on your computer.

### **Step 2: Prepare the SD Card with Raspberry Pi OS**
1. **Open Raspberry Pi Imager**.
2. **Choose the Operating System**:
   - Select **Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit)** or **Raspberry Pi OS Lite** (if you want a minimal setup).
3. **Select Storage**:
   - Insert your SD card into your computer, and choose it as the target.
4. **Write the OS** to the SD card:
   - Click **Write** and wait for the process to finish.

### **Step 3: Boot the Raspberry Pi**
1. **Insert the SD card** into the Raspberry Pi.
2. **Connect the Raspberry Pi**:
   - Attach a monitor, keyboard, and mouse (if doing a headless setup, you can skip this step).
   - Connect to power, and the Raspberry Pi will boot.
3. **Follow the on-screen setup instructions**:
   - Set up country, language, and time zone.
   - Create a username and password (default is often `pi`/`raspberry` but you can change it).

---

### **Step 4: Connect Raspberry Pi to Wi-Fi or Ethernet**
1. **For Wi-Fi**:
   - If you are using a monitor and keyboard, you will be prompted to select a Wi-Fi network during setup.
   - Choose your Wi-Fi network and enter the password.
2. **For Ethernet**:
   - Simply plug in the Ethernet cable. It should automatically connect to the network.

### **Step 5: Update the Raspberry Pi**
It’s important to update the Raspberry Pi to ensure you have the latest security patches and software.

1. **Open the terminal** (or connect via SSH if headless):
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```
   
2. **Reboot** (optional, but recommended):
   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

### **Step 6: Enable SSH (if using headless setup or remote access)**
SSH allows you to connect to your Raspberry Pi from another computer.

1. **Open terminal** and run:
   ```bash
   sudo raspi-config
   ```
2. **Navigate to Interface Options > SSH**, and enable it.
3. **Find your Raspberry Pi’s IP address**:
   ```bash
   hostname -I
   ```
4. **Connect via SSH** from another machine:
1. to find your IP address then **Open terminal** and type:
    ```bash
   ip a
   ```
   Then type:
   ```bash
   ssh pi@IP_ADDRESS
   ```
   Replace `IP_ADDRESS` with the actual IP address of the Raspberry Pi that we found earlier.

### **Step 7: Install Essential Software**
Here are some common software tools you might want to install on your Raspberry Pi:

#### **Install Git**
```bash
sudo apt install git
```

#### **Install Python 3 and Pip**
```bash
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
```

#### **Install OpenSSH**
```bash
sudo apt install openssh-server
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
```

---

### **Step 8: Expand the File System (if necessary)**
If you are using a new SD card, you might want to expand the file system to utilize the full space.

1. **Open raspi-config**:
   ```bash
   sudo raspi-config
   ```
2. **Select Advanced Options > Expand Filesystem**.
3. **Reboot** for changes to take effect:
   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

### **Step 9: Install Additional Software (Optional)**

#### **MariaDB (Database Server)**
1. **Install MariaDB**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install mariadb-server
   sudo systemctl start mariadb
   sudo systemctl enable mariadb
   ```
2. **Secure MariaDB**:
   ```bash
   sudo mysql_secure_installation
   ```

#### **Install a Web Server (Apache)**
1. **Install Apache**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install apache2
   ```
2. **Enable and start Apache**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable apache2
   sudo systemctl start apache2
   ```

#### **Install PHP**
1. **Install PHP**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php
   ```

---

### **Step 10: Set Up Automatic Backups (Optional)**
1. **Install rsync** for automatic backups:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install rsync
   ```
2. **Set up cron jobs** to automate backups:
   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```

---

### **Step 11: Access Your Raspberry Pi Remotely**
Once you have SSH enabled, you can easily connect to your Raspberry Pi from any computer on the same network.

1. **From a Linux/macOS machine**:
   ```bash
   ssh pi@IP_ADDRESS
   ```
2. **From a Windows machine**:
   - Use [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/) to SSH into your Raspberry Pi.
